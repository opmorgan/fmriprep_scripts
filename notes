- Installed dcm2bis:
 pip install --user --upgrade dcm2bids

 pip install pydeface --user
 (Note: use default destination to save defaced brains as new files rather than overwriting existing niftis)

- Installing mriqc
docker run -it poldracklab/mriqc:latest --version

- Installing fmriprep
pip install --user --upgrade fmriprep-docker

- Installing TemplateFlow
